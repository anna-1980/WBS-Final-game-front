Hello :) 

This is a repository containing front end part if a final project for graduating my Full Stack Web-Dev Boot Camp. 
It is an beginning of a gaming portal project which I called: 

Science Arcade

The main idea here is to teach scientific concepts and nomenclature through gaming...
I mean so many of us like games, also the simple min ones played while waiting in a queue.
How many times you remember the details of even the simplest game you played, the names of characters, places objects etc. Some of them stay with us for years. 
So, I thought why not use that in education and create games which teach but hopefully are not boarding but engaging. 
So here is a beginning of the Science Arcade platform, where information and education meet in one space :) 

I made, for now two mini games using Phaser3 framework.
The Science Arcade platform itself is a React app connecting to a small API I build. In turn my API connects to a Netlify API which allows to automatically deploy a website from a zip file (Phaser games are in rendered in HTML canvas) which is how new games can be uploaded to my Science Arcade library.

I hope you enjoy my idea and contact me if you have any questions or comments :) 



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
