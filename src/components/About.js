          <h3>Hello everyone.</h3>
          <p>It all started with my passion about science. I am a biologist by education and training.
            I also like to game, a bit. My life path led me through interest in plant physiology, drosophila development over to graphic desing...
             Yes, you know I always liket to communicate y science with a few extra pictures and graphics here and there. 
             A time has come one day that I desired to have my own website in the world wide web. Like many trained researchers I began to,
              well google how to make a website üòÖ . It turned out not so easy for someone who had neer done it. There is html, there is CSS and ... 
              there is Javascript. Well luckily for me I found out there are great courser where in just a few month you can turn a 
              nONE coder into a CODER üòÅ.
              So here I am, coding my own websites and GAMES. My inner voicees (yes I hear more that one ü§î ) of the grapfic designer and the scientist whispered to me:
             </p>
             <h3>- üëª You should make a GAME and Design it yourself, and it should be about SCIENCE...</h3>
             <p>And there you go, here is my little space for all the games which contain a little bit of science in there</p>
             <h3>Did I mentione I love to teach science?</h3>
             <p>Explain things look for information. But learning science, also for me was not always easy.I am sure many of you can relate</p>
             <h3>Therefore I decided to use all my skills and bring about his platform, where you can enjoy playing mini games and learn some scientific facts while doing so.</h3>
               <p>I mean do you even recall gaming? And do you recall all the odd names of characters you played and the places they visited and the temples and lands...
                 So why not learning a few science facts this way too? I hope you enjoy the games, relax, and learn something here. </p>
